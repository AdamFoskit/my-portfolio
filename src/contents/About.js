                Iâ€™m a 23 year old Software Engineer that graduated from college
                in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I
                have a strong passion for Software Development and love learning
                new technologies. I have over 1 year of professional experience
                in Mobile Application development, mostly in React Native. I
                have had the opportunity to work with AWS, GraphQL, RESTful
                APIs, for Back-End development. For Front-End development, I
                work with React, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (using hundreds of
                dependencies). I love the idea of cross-platform development,
                which web technology like Javascript, and frameworks like React
                enable me to do. I also like spending time reading the most
                up-to-date technologies and frameworks, and benchmarking
                different JavaScript coding solutions.
