                    Iâ€™m a 23 year old, graduating in May 2020 with a Bachelor of
                    Science in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for
                    Software Development and love learning new technologies. I
                    have over 1 year of professional experience in Mobile
                    Application development, mostly in React-Native. I have had
                    the opportunity to work with AWS, GraphQL, RESTful APIs, for
                    Back-End development. For Front-End development, I work with
                    React, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and hundreds of
                    dependencies. I love the idea of cross-platform development,
                    which web technology like Javascrip, and frameworks like
                    React enable me to do. I also like spending time reading the
                    most up-to-date technologies and frameworks, and working on
                    optimizing code.
